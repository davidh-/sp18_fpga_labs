3.1 Checkoff Questions

1. How many SLICEs are in a single CLB?

2. How many inputs do each of the LUTs on a Zynq-7000 FPGA have?

3. How many LUTs does the 7z020 have?

4. How do you implement logic functions of 7 inputs in a single SLICEL? How about 8? Draw a high-level circuit diagram to show how the implementation would look. Be specifc about the elements (LUTs, muxes) that are used.


5. What is the difference between a SLICEL and a SLICEM?
